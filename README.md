Implementing CSGNet:  Neural Shape Parser for Constructive Solid Geometry for CS492 Project

TimeLine:
4/14 ∼ 4/21: Download the datasets and implement data preprocessing, loss function, encoder, decoder for 2D first.  
4/21 ∼ 4/28: Implement Beam search and other utility function.  
4/28 ∼ 5/12: Implement RL part and join them all together and check accuracy etc.  
5/12 ∼ 5/19: Implement the whole thing for 3D datas and check etc.  
5/19 ∼ 6/6: Make reports, poster, organize codes
